# tictactoe
Tic-tac-toe game created in React.
Based initially on the tutorial from reactjs.org. Changes and added features include:
        1. Class components refactored into functional components with useState() hooks.
        2. Components refactored into external files.
        3. Move history list modified to display player & coordinate for each turn.
        4. <Board/> refactored to render rows and squares using nested loops/maps.
        5. Move history button order made flippable.
        6. Winning squares will be highlighted in red at end of game.
        7. Move history buttons will only appear if the game has started.
        8. Appearance changed in CSS. Alternate color palettes can be commented in if desired.
